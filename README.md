Hi, I’m Ethan Meredith — a UK-based aspiring **full stack developer** and current IT technician for a trust.

I manage users and onboarding with **Azure AD**, and streamline workflows using **Power Apps** and **Power Automate**. I'm learning **JavaScript**, **Python** and many more languages to build clean, efficient applications.

Interested in **development** and automation. I also enjoy gaming — especially **League of Legends** and **Factorio**.

Let's connect and build something cool!
